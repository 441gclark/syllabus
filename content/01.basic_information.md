## Description of the course

Welcome to CEE Data Science!
This semester, you  will learn to leverage data to study civil and environmental engineering problems, identify patterns, and make actionable insights.
This course combines training in digital and computer tools—including distributed computing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling and deep learning—with application of those tools to civil and environmental engineering issues.

This course differs from other available machine learning and data science courses in that it focuses on civil and environmental engineering problems and the methods used to solve them. In particular, this course emphasizes working with spatial data, which is common in physical science but less common in data science when applied to other disciplines.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1. Use software tools for data processing and visualization, machine learning, and deep learning to
2. Retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data; and
3. Make inferences and predictions about the (built) environment.

This course will help you to gain the skills and tools necessary to make the most of the great increases in the amount and quality of data related to civil and environmental engineering that is being collected and stored.

Because data science methods are used across a number of different industries and instructional materials are readily available, this course will include readings and video lectures from across the internet.
We will focus our face-to-face time on learning aspects of civil and environmental data science that differ from data science as used by other fields, and on applying data science concepts to solving physical problems.
This course will be structured around semester-long projects; students will choose project topics at the beginning of the semester and will apply the concepts learned in the class to their projects as the semester progresses.

## Prerequisites

* CEE 202;
* CEE300, 330 or 360; and
* CS 101 or equivalent.

## Course Requirements and Assessment Overview
* Grades will be assigned based on several types of deliverables:
  * Mini quizzes and assignments on readings and video lectures, due before class: 20% of total grade
  * Quizzes: 5% of final grade
  * Homework problem sets: 15% of final grade
  * Midterm exam: 5% of final grade
  * Final exam: 15% of final grade
  * Course project: 40% of final grade: 5% each for each of 5 checkpoints, 5% for midterm presentation, and 10% for final presentation.
* Graduate students are expected to register for 4 credits and undergraduates are expected to register for 3 credits. Correspondingly, course projects for graduate students are expected to include a machine learning component that is more complex than linear regression, whereas for undergraduates this is optional.
* Grades will be assigned according to the attached rubrics.
* Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:
  * 90%-100%: A
  * 80%-89%: B
  * 70%-79%: C
  * 60%-69%: D
  * <60%: F

## Learning Resources
* Students are expected to bring a laptop to class. Laptops can be [loaned from the library](https://www.library.illinois.edu/mc/lt/).
* There is no required textbook to purchase. Course material will draw from a number of sources across the internet:
  * [*The Introduction to Earth Data Science Textbook*](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/), CU Boulder Earth Lab.
  * Video lectures from [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/), and [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/lectures)
  * Jupyter notebooks from [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/articles/topic1-exploratory-data-analysis-with-pandas/) and [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/scipy2018-geospatial-data)

* Some supplemental textbooks which students may find useful are:
  * Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython
  * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow

## Inclusive Statement

The effectiveness of this course is dependent upon the creation of an encouraging and safe classroom environment. Exclusionary, offensive or harmful speech (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.) will not be tolerated and in some cases subject to University harassment procedures. We are all responsible for creating a positive and safe environment that allows all students equal respect and comfort. I expect each of you to help establish and maintain and environment where you and your peers can contribute without fear of ridicule or intolerant or offensive language.

## Netiquette

In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more enjoyable and productive communication. The following are tips for interacting online via e-mail or discussion board messages, adapted from guidelines originally compiled by Chuq Von Rospach and Gene Spafford (1995):

* Remember that the person receiving your message is someone like you, deserving and appreciating courtesy and respect
* Avoid typing whole sentences or phrases in Caps Lock
* Be brief; succinct, thoughtful messages have the greatest effect
* Your messages reflect on you personally; take time to make sure that you are proud of their form and content
* Use descriptive subject headings in your e-mails
* Think about your audience and the relevance of your messages
* Be careful when you use humor and sarcasm; absent the voice inflections and body language that aid face-to-face communication, Internet messages are easy to misinterpret
* When making follow-up comments, summarize the parts of the message to which you are responding
* Avoid repeating what has already been said; needless repetition is ineffective communication
* Cite appropriate references whenever using someone else's ideas, thoughts, or words
