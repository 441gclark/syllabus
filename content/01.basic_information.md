## Description of the course

Welcome to Environmental Data Science!
This semester, you  will learn to leverage data to study environmental problems, identify patterns, and make actionable insights.
This course combines training in digital and computer tools—including distributed computing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling and deep learning—with application of those tools to environmental issues.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1. Use software tools for data processing and visualization, machine learning, and deep learning to
2. Retrieve, manipulate, and analyze environmental data; and
3. Make inferences and predictions about the environment.

This course will help you to gain the skills and tools necessary to make the most of the great increases in the amount and quality of environmental data that is being collected and stored.

Because data science methods are used across a number of different industries and instructional materials are readily available, this course will include readings and video lectures from across the internet.
We will focus our face-to-face time on learning aspects of environmental data science that differ from data science as used by other fields, and on applying data science concepts to solving environmental problems.
This course will be structured around semester-long projects; students will choose project topics at the beginning of the semester and will apply the concepts learned in the class to their projects as the semester progresses.

## Prerequisites

CEE 202; CS 101 or equivalent.

## Course Requirements and Assessment Overview
* Grades will be assigned based on several types of deliverables:
  * Mini quizzes and assignments on readings and video lectures, due before class: 20% of total grade
  * Homework problem sets: 20% of final grade
  * Midterm and final exams: 5% each of final grade
  * Course project: 50% of final grade: 5% each for each of 5 checkpoints, 10% for midterm presentation, and 15% for final presentation.
* Grades will be assigned according to the attached rubrics.
* Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:
  * 90%-100%: A
  * 80%-89%: B
  * 70%-79%: C
  * 60%-69%: D
  * <60%: F

## Learning Resources
* Students are expected to bring a laptop to class. Laptops can be [loaned from the library](https://www.library.illinois.edu/mc/lt/).
* There is no required textbook. Some supplmental textbooks which students may find useful are:
  * Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython
  * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
