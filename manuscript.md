## Description of the course

Welcome to Environmental Data Science!
This semester, you  will learn to leverage data to study environmental problems, identify patterns, and make actionable insights.
This course combines training in digital and computer tools—including distributed computing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling and deep learning—with application of those tools to environmental issues.

This course differs from other available machine learning and data science courses in that it focuses on environmental problems and the methods used to solve them. In particular, this course emphasizes working with spatial data, which is common in environmental science but less common in data science when applied to other disciplines.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1. Use software tools for data processing and visualization, machine learning, and deep learning to
2. Retrieve, manipulate, and analyze environmental data; and
3. Make inferences and predictions about the environment.

This course will help you to gain the skills and tools necessary to make the most of the great increases in the amount and quality of environmental data that is being collected and stored.

Because data science methods are used across a number of different industries and instructional materials are readily available, this course will include readings and video lectures from across the internet.
We will focus our face-to-face time on learning aspects of environmental data science that differ from data science as used by other fields, and on applying data science concepts to solving environmental problems.
This course will be structured around semester-long projects; students will choose project topics at the beginning of the semester and will apply the concepts learned in the class to their projects as the semester progresses.

## Prerequisites

* CS 101 or equivalent;
* CEE 202; and
* one of CEE 300, 330 or 360.

## Course Requirements and Assessment Overview
* Grades will be assigned based on several types of deliverables:
  * Mini quizzes and assignments on readings and video lectures, due before class: 20% of total grade
  * Quizzes: 5% of final grade
  * Homework problem sets: 15% of final grade
  * Midterm exam: 5% of final grade
  * Final exam: 15% of final grade
  * Course project: 40% of final grade: 5% each for each of 5 checkpoints, 5% for midterm presentation, and 10% for final presentation.
* Graduate students are expected to register for 4 credits and undergraduates are expected to register for 3 credits. Correspondingly, course projects for graduate students are expected to include a machine learning component that is more complex than linear regression, whereas for undergraduates this is optional.
* Grades will be assigned according to the attached rubrics.
* Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:
  * 90%-100%: A
  * 80%-89%: B
  * 70%-79%: C
  * 60%-69%: D
  * <60%: F

## Learning Resources
* Students are expected to bring a laptop to class. Laptops can be [loaned from the library](https://www.library.illinois.edu/mc/lt/).
* There is no required textbook to purchase, and in my opinion static text is not always the best medium for learning this type of content. Course material will draw from a number of sources across the internet:
  * [*The Introduction to Earth Data Science Textbook*](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/), CU Boulder Earth Lab.
  * Video lectures from [Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/), and [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/lectures)
  * Jupyter notebooks from [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/articles/topic1-exploratory-data-analysis-with-pandas/) and [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/scipy2018-geospatial-data)

* Some supplemental textbooks (freely available online) which students may find useful are:
  * Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython
  * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
