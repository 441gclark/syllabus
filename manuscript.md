## Description of the course

Welcome to Environmental Data Science!
This semester, you  will learn to leverage data to study environmental problems, identify patterns, and make actionable insights.
This course combines training in digital and computer tools—including distributed computing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling and deep learning—with application of those tools to environmental issues.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:
1. Use software tools for data processing and visualization, machine learning, and deep learning to
2. Retrieve, manipulate, and analyze environmental data; and
3. Make inferences and predictions about the environment.

This course will help you to gain the skills and tools necessary to make the most of the great increases in the amount and quality of environmental data that is being collected and stored.
